## What is Sivi?

Sivi provides powerful AI-driven design generation capabilities through both low-level core APIs and UI SDK. Whether you're building a design application, integrating design generation into your existing platform, or looking to generate designs programmatically, Sivi offers flexible solutions to meet your needs. Beyond templates and images! Use Sivi's Large Design Model (LDM) to generate customizable graphic designs - ad creatives, social posts, ecommerce banners, YouTube thumbnails, and more.

## How Sivi Generates Designs?

Sivi uses advanced AI to create editable, multi-layered vector designs from either text prompts or content inputs. Understanding these generation pathways helps you choose the right approach for your specific needs.

## Sivi's Design Generation Process

- **Input Processing**: Your text prompt is analyzed for design intent, style references, and content requirements
- **Design Planning**: Sivi determines layout structure, visual hierarchy, and component relationships
- **Element Generation**: Individual design elements are created with appropriate styling
- **Composition**: Elements are assembled into a cohesive, multi-layered design
- **Refinement**: The design is optimized for visual harmony and usability
